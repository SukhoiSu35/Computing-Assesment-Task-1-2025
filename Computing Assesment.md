# Project proposal

# Design Brief 
My project is to create a website based on Roger Federer's history. My target audience is people of every age, specifically youngsters who want to join the game of tennis. The book contains all about Roger Federer and the struggles he has been through. The trophies he has won 

# Book Choice and Justification
The name of the book is The Roger Federer Story by Rene Stauffer. The biography sheds light on Federer’s humility, professionalism, and contributions beyond tennis, including his philanthropy through the Roger Federer Foundation. It presents Federer not just as an extraordinary athlete but also as a global sports icon and role model.

# User experience type 
The format of my project will be a web format and the themes of the book will be enhanced when I explore the story briefly on every page of the website 

# Target Market 
Primarily aimed at teenagers and adults (ages 14 and up) due to its detailed biographical and analytical content, this project will appeal to them, by showing the resilience and hard work of Roger Federer. My design choices will be colourful and catchy so the eyes of the audience will be pleased 

# Software and tools 
For the website, I will be using either GitHub or Vercel because of the great options of the hosting and I will use Google Analytics or youtube seo to track the analytics of the website  


# Functional Requirements 
The app will allow users to see all the medals and trophies that Roger Federer has acheiced in his lifetime which was covered through out the book. The app is designed to promote the book 

**USE CASE**

Users can explore chapters about key moments in Federer's career

Users can take a quiz to test their knowledge about Roger Federer 

Users can view all the awards of Roger Federer 

Users can read the summary of the book 

**TEST CASES**

1. Starting a Quiz

Expected Behavior:

When the user selects the "Start Quiz" button, the app will display the first question, with available options clearly shown.

2. Career Timeline Navigation


Expected Behavior:

When the user selects "Career Timeline" from the navigation menu, the app will load a timeline displaying key events from Federer’s career.
Users will be able to scroll through the timeline smoothly, with interactive markers for major tournaments, victories, and milestones.

3. Image Loading in Gallery

All images in the gallery are displayed without missing or broken links and load correctly as the user scrolls through the page.

4. Responsive Design 

The website layout adapts seamlessly to desktop, tablet, and smartphone screen sizes, with all elements displayed optimally.

# NON FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

**Performance**


 Fast Navigation: Ensuring that, under typical usage, every page loads in less than a second.

 Optimized Assets: To preserve fast response times, minimize JavaScript and compress pictures.

 Effective Data Display: Using non gif content to speed up loading times and lower server load.

 **USABILITY**

 Simple Layout: A clear,  framework that makes navigation easy.

 Basic Accessibility: The website's simplicity may limit advanced accessibility capabilities, however fonts and colors are selected for better visual aesthetic and readability.

 Clear Labels: All buttons and links have clear labels to make it easier for users to browse the website.

 **RELIABILITY**


Cross-Device Testing: Test thoroughly on a variety of devices (e.g., smartphones, tablets, desktops) and screen sizes to ensure proper functionality everywhere.

Automated & Manual Testing: Incorporate both automated testing (e.g., unit tests) and manual testing to catch issues during development.

Error Reporting: Implement an in-app bug report mechanism so users can flag issues directly, aiding continuous improvement.

**SECURITY**

Basic Encryption: The website will use simple methods to protect data (like HTTPS), but it might not stop advanced hacking attempts.

Simple Login System: Users will log in using basic accounts, without extra safety steps like two-factor authentication. This is because the website is meant for kids and doesn't store sensitive data.

Limited Data Collection: The website will only ask for basic details like a username or nickname. Kids will be shown a clear and simple message explaining why their information is needed.

Few Updates: Fixing problems with security won't happen often because the website is made for fun and learning, and it doesn’t handle important or risky information.

# SOCIAL IMPACT

**Target Audience Considerations**

The primary audience for this experience includes tennis fans, sports enthusiasts, and readers interested in biographies of inspirational figures. Additionally, educators, sports analysts, and young athletes may find value in the content.

Accessibility

**Potential Risks**


Some biographical aspects, such as Federer’s career setbacks, rivalries, or criticisms, might be interpreted differently by various audiences.

Risk of misrepresenting Federer’s character or legacy if content is not presented properly.

# ETHICAL IMPACT

**User Data & Privacy**

If the prototype collects user data (e.g., engagement metrics, community discussions), privacy policies must be clearly outlined.

Users should have option to disable data recording on the site 

**Representation & Inclusion**

Content should accurately reflect Federer’s career, values, and contributions to tennis.

Diverse perspectives, including those of Federer’s opponents, journalists, and fans worldwide, should be represented.

**Content Sensitivity**

While Federer’s story is largely inspirational, any sensitive topics (e.g., controversies, injuries, or defeats) should be presented with balance and fairness.

# LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS



Copyright & Intellectual Property

Any use of book content, images, or direct quotes must comply with copyright laws and fair use principles.

Original assets should be created where possible, or appropriate permissions and attributions should be obtained.



**Terms of Use**

# PMI CHART          
| **UI Name**   | **Plus** | **Minus** | **Implication** |
|--------------|----------|-----------|------------------|
| **Canva UI** | Canva is easy to use because you can drag and drop things. It has many ready-made templates that help you design quickly.  You can work with your team at the same time on the same design.  The layout looks nice and is simple to understand. | Some good features cost money, so free users miss out.  There are many tools, which can be confusing for new users.  It can be slow if your design is very large. | Canva is great for making design easy and fun.  We should also keep things simple and smooth in our project.  But we need to avoid too many tools or slow performance. |
| **Google UI** | Google is simple and fast to use.  The search results are helpful and well shown.  Google apps work well together.  The design is clean and not distracting. | Some features are hidden and hard to find.  Some apps like Google Drive can feel crowded.  Personalized results might not always show different views. | Google’s design shows that simple and fast is good.  In our project, we should keep things easy to use.  We also need to make sure all features are easy to find. |
| **Instagram UI** | Instagram looks good and is fun to use.  It’s easy to move around the app.  Features like Stories and Reels are easy to find.  Dark mode is also helpful for night use. | The feed shows random posts, not just from people you follow.  Ads can be annoying.  The explore page shows too much at once. | Instagram is a good example of a fun and visual design. For our project, we should keep it fun but not too busy.  Giving users control over what they see will help. |

# EVALUATION

**Usability**

With the feedback I recieved, I came up with a few common things that I should have implemented, first was to add more items to the web, to make better use of space.  

**Aesthetics**

Additionally I overall recieved 7 out of 10 for the aesthetics, and I realised that I should have incorporated more aesthetically pleasing features to make it a better wireframe.

**Functionality**

Overall it meets the projects purpose and aims to engage people within tennis 

# PROTOTYPE 1 

My first prototype was the first page of the website, it consisted of an image of roger federer as the background and a large text of roger federer on the front. In the top left corner it was the site name and in the top right corner was the Interactable buttons to go on another page like as shown 

![alt text](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1338167173889261621/1375085105814437948/image.png?ex=6830674d&is=682f15cd&hm=b1ef893d99da51191a47150a95311a0b33c7ce5dada1ccc48a1f9aff623c153b&=&format=webp&quality=lossless&width=1100&height=584)


**Testing**

I tried testing with multiple different images. I also interviewed friends and family as to their opinion on this and I went through some changes with the background and the font to make it look more visually appealing 

**Evaluate**

In this first part, I dont think I made that great use of space and it wasnt as visually appealing as others because it just had 1 part of text and some background, but the navigation was generally preety easy 

# PROTOTYPE 2 

I made a prototype of a website about Roger Federer. It includes a homepage, an awards page, and a quiz. The awards page shows a motivational quote and lists his Grand Slam wins. I also added images of Federer with trophies to make it more engaging.
![alt text](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1338167173889261621/1375085286836666491/image.png?ex=68306778&is=682f15f8&hm=7aa03975bec7ad5fe8eb6f78b158244ffda4480b1dffdaf5194f5b91a40f54e1&=&format=webp&quality=lossless&width=1100&height=584)
![alt text](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1338167173889261621/1375085432299196476/image.png?ex=6830679a&is=682f161a&hm=b83532971caaa2eee31d6201cfc6a2e2b2cb99a4f09e4a78f71a2c10f45aeb89&=&format=webp&quality=lossless&width=2420&height=1286)




**Testing**

Using my previous wireframes, I created this prototype in resemblance to the wireframe. After asking people to see the site and review it, I changed the way the quote was presented.

**Evaluate**

Users liked the design and how simple it was to use. Some suggested adding more interactive features. Based on this, I’ll improve the design by making it more responsive and adding more engaging elements like a working quiz.


# PROTOTYPE 3

I made an interactive quiz where users can test their knowledge about roger federer, replicating all the information on the previous pages. This quiz consists of 10 questions and the results come instantly after the quiz is finished

![alt text](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1338167173889261621/1375085601027522610/image.png?ex=683067c3&is=682f1643&hm=70e18d68172bbdd81ec455e577ef055e9f7c36cfc47ee798a3a34f5722f38ea4&=&format=webp&quality=lossless&width=2420&height=1286)

![alt text](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1338167173889261621/1375085752198627400/image.png?ex=683067e7&is=682f1667&hm=fbb227e0ddc828aab8ebaa3f71254ea935c938e62f9d4aa5c16db4399393495e&=&format=webp&quality=lossless&width=2420&height=1286)



**Testing**

I made this prototype very similar to the wireframe that i fixed based on feedback. I also checked that this page was accessible and it was easy for users to navigate up and down the page. I surveyed 3 people to see how easy the quiz was to navigate through and if the page looked appealing

**Evaluate**

Users liked the design and how simple it was to use. Some suggested adding more interactive features. Based on this, I’ll improve the design by making it more responsive and adding more engaging elements like a working quiz.


# FINAL EVALUATION 

1. How well does the product meet its requirements?

The website works as planned. Users can read about Roger Federer, see his trophies, take quizzes, and look at timelines. It loads quickly and works on different devices. The site is easy to use with clear buttons, but it could be more accessible for people with disabilities. 

2. Does the product meet the goals from the design plan?

The website fits the goal of telling Federer’s story and is made for teenagers and adults. The design uses bright colors and simple layouts to keep users engaged, It shares important parts of Federer’s life, just like the book says. Overall, it matches what was planned.

3. Does the project follow social, ethical, and legal rules?

The project respects users privacy by only asking for no information and logs nothing. It tries to be fair and honest about Federer’s life

4. How well was time and resources managed?

The project shows good planning with steps like making quizzes and galleries. Testing is done to find and fix problems. Tools like Weebl were chosen to help manage the website, which was different from the previous plan of using github or vercel. Overall, my plan from the gantt chart was follwed almost to perfection 

5. How was user feedback and testing handled?

The feedback was handled nicely and all thoughts were considered. Each time I had feedback, I underwent some more testing to find ways on making the site better
